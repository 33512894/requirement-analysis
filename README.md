Requirement Analysis in Software Development

What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Gathering: Methods to collect initial needs from stakeholders, including interviews, surveys, workshops, observation, and document analysis.

Requirement Elicitation: Techniques for drawing out more detailed ideas and requirements, such as brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping.

Requirement Documentation: How to formally record the collected requirements using tools like Requirement Specification Documents, User Stories, and Use Cases.

Requirement Analysis and Modeling: The process of evaluating and refining requirements, involving prioritization, feasibility analysis, and creating visual models (e.g., DFDs, ERDs).

Requirement Validation: Ensuring the documented requirements are correct and complete through stakeholder reviews, defining acceptance criteria, and maintaining traceability.

Types of Requirements
Functional Requirements
Describe what the system should do

examples
User Management:User (Guest/Host) Registration and Login,User Profile Management
Property Management (Host-Specific):Add/Edit/Delete Property Listing, Manage Property Details (location, type, amenities, pricing), Manage Property Availability/CalendarsUpload/Manage Property Images
Search & Discovery (Guest-Specific):Search for properties by criteria (location, dates, price, type, amenities)View Search Results (with filters/sorting), View Detailed Property Information (description, photos, reviews)


Non-functional Requirements
Describe how the system should perform
examples
Scalability:
Ability to handle high volumes of users, properties, and bookings.
Efficient scaling for peak loads.
Availability/Reliability:
High uptime and minimal downtime.
Reliable and atomic booking/payment transactions.
Performance:
Fast search query responses.
Responsive booking and payment processes.
Optimized image loading.
Security:
Protection of user data (personal, payment).
Robust authentication and authorization.
Protection against vulnerabilities.

Use Case Diagrams
What are Use Case Diagrams?
Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases).
